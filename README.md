 Lending Club Case Study
	About the Company: This company is the largest **online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures**. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to **â€˜riskyâ€™** applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). **Credit loss** is the amount of money lost by the lender **when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed**. In other words, **borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss** to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as **'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'**

Business Understanding: When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

**Two types of risks** are associated with the bankâ€™s decision: - If the applicant is **likely to repay** the loan, then **not approving the loan results in a loss of business** to the company - If the applicant is **not likely to repay** the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then **approving the loan may lead to a financial loss** for the company.
Business Requirements (Objective of this Case Study): The company wants to understand the **driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default**, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can **utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment**. If risky loan applicants can be identified early, then **such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss**. Therefore, the need is to Perform a Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Lending Club Loans Data: - To identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default. - To understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. - Recommend actions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, lending at a higher interest rate, etc.

** Approach followed for Exploratory Data Analysis:**
 Below are the steps that would followed for performing this EDA:

1. Importing necessary libraries & Loading Data for Analysis
2. Data Understanding
	2.1   Exploring the Data Dictionary
	2.2   Exploring Data Structure, Data Shape and Size
	2.3   Null Values & Unique Values Analysis
3. Data Wrangling
	3.1   Remove Unwanted Columns and Rows
	3.2   Missing Values Treatment
	3.3   Derived Metrics Columns
	3.4   Data Segmentation
	3.5   Outliers Treatment
4. Data Analysis
	4.1   Univariate Analysis
	4.2   Bivariate Analysis
	4.3   Multivariate Analysis
5. Summarising Observations
